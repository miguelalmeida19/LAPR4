## Explanations / Decisions

### Customer and Shopping Cart connection

- In our domain model, we built a link between the customer and the shopping cart with a multiplicity of one to one, that is, each customer can only be associated with one shopping cart at a time. This decision was taken in this way in productOrder to facilitate the validation of the shopping cart and the removal of items from it so that later it is possible, or not, for the customer to obtain their respective productOrder.

### Lack of connection between shopping cart and productOrder

- In our domain model, our team chose not to make a direct connection between the productOrder and shopping cart entity, because in this way, the customer is not obliged to place an productOrder whenever items are introduced into the shopping cart.
